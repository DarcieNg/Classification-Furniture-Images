## 🌟 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a **Furniture Recommendation System** that utilizes deep learning to classify furniture images and suggest similar items. Users upload furniture images, and the system provides category-based recommendations using advanced image processing techniques.


## 🛠️ Project Tasks

### Task 1: Furniture Category Classification

Classify images into six furniture categories (e.g., tables, chairs). Models such as **CNN**, **ResNet50**, and **InceptionV3** were used, with **InceptionV3** chosen for its superior accuracy.

| Model       | Train Accuracy | Validation Accuracy |
|-------------|----------------|---------------------|
| CNN         | 71.52%         | 71.56%              |
| ResNet50    | 93.09%         | 90.52%              |
| **InceptionV3** | **97.46%**  | **96.63%**          |

### Task 2: Finding Similar Furniture by Category

This task focuses on identifying 10 similar images to a given input using **ResNet50** and the **NearestNeighbors** algorithm.



### Task 3: Finding Similar Furniture by Category and Style

Further refines the similarity search by incorporating both category and style information. **ResNet50** continues to be the main architecture used.

## 🗂️ Datasets

The dataset includes **90,000+ images** categorized into 6 types of furniture and 11 interior styles. Preprocessing involved duplicate removal and resizing to fit model inputs.

| Category  | Percentage |
|-----------|------------|
| Lamps     | 36%        |
| Chairs    | 25%        |
| Tables    | 20%        |

## 🧠 Models Used

1. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**: Used as a baseline for image classification.
2. **ResNet50**: Employed for both feature extraction and classification in all tasks.
3. **InceptionV3**: Provided the best accuracy for the image classification task.
